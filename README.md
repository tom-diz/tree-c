# C Project - November 2022 by Tom Dizdarevic, Thambir Nazrul Islam, Louis Vanlaeres
=============

### Project Overview
This project was developed for a second-year student assignment at EFREI. Its objective is to create a program that automatically generates grammatically and, if possible, orthographically correct sentences, even if they may not necessarily make sense.

### Installation Guide

#### Usage Tips
For this project, we recommend using Visual Studio Code to display our code with proper syntax highlighting.

#### Visual Studio Code Installation (Example IDE)
1. In a web browser, go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download the version for your operating system (supports Windows, Linux, and macOS).
3. Once downloaded, run the installation program.

#### Running the Program
1. Download the source code from the GitHub project and unzip the .zip file.
2. Compile the main.c file and execute it. (be sure to include the `main.c` and `func.c` files during compilation) ⚠️ Only compatible on Windows since we are using the `windows.h` import.
